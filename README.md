# Project Overview

For my final project in _DSC-478: Programming Machine Learning Application_, I weighed multiple algorithms against each other to determine the best fit for predicting the sales price of real estate in New York City. The algorithms I looked in to were:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Naive Bayes
* K-Means

Reduction in the dimensionality of the dataset was handled by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
