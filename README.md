# Project Overview

For my final project in _DSC-478: Programming Machine Learning Application_, I weighed multiple algorithms against each other to determine the best fit for predicting the sale price of real estate in New York City. My predictions were based on several characteristics such as location, type, and sale date. The algorithms I looked in to were:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
* K-Means

> NOTE: Reduction in the dimensionality of the dataset was handled by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.

## Project Timeline

1) Analyzed dataset to determine variables, and best approach for processing.
2) Converted categorical variables into dummy variables.
3) Split data into training and testing, and normalized the data.
4) Processed data using the above machine learning techniques.
